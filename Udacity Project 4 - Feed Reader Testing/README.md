## Descciption
This testing project is mainly based on Jasmine JavaScript library. 
The test suits include:
1. Test the RSS feeds definitions and the allFeeds variables
* 

    
5. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty
    * Think about how you wrote the previous test. What are you testing for this time?
6. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
7. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default
    * You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how the hiding/showing of the menu element is implemented
    * What code in `app.js` is directly involved with toggling the menu on and off?
8. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display itself when clicked, and does it hide when clicked again?
    * Think about how you wrote the previous test. What is different this time around?
    * Which clickable element are you checking for?
    * How do you "simulate" a mouse click that element without actually clicking it?
9. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
10. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container
    * How does Jasmine's `beforeEach()`function work?
    * How does the `loadFeed()` function in `app.js` work? Is it synchronous or asynchronous?
11. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
12. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes
    * How is this test different from the previous test?
