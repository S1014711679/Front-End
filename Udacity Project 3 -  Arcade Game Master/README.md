## Descciption

The movements of the character is controlled by the arrows (up,down,left,right). The character must avoid collision with sprites from the second row to the forth row. And the character can't stay in the water-block for over 3 minutes. Otherwise, the location will be reset to the original location.

I used ES5 "class" style for the [app.js](https://github.com/S1014711679/Front-End/blob/master/Udacity%20Project%203%20-%20%20Arcade%20Game%20Master/js/app.js)) and used ES6 Class for [app_class.js](https://github.com/S1014711679/Front-End/blob/master/Udacity%20Project%203%20-%20%20Arcade%20Game%20Master/js/app_class.js). Both files have the same functions. We can make changes in index.html file to check out.
